I have a microscopy experiment I am interested in analyzing to see if the data show some type of separation between the infected and uninfected phenotypes, but to do this i need to intergrate a host of tools so that I can use an existing ML package (omnipose) to segment the cells which will enable for robust QC calculations and msot importantly will allow us to be under the microscope taking images, and analyzing our cell intensities, background intensities, and most importantly how they change across z-stacks to ensure our imaging parameters dont bias or mask our results in anyway (I am seeing what could be significant itnensity reductions in the zstacks which seem to correlate directly with the stage# meaning how many fluorescence images were taken before the current frame is taken, being photobleching effects eventhough I am using Alexafluor 488 whhich i thought to be fairly photostable).  

You are encouraged to ask any questions for clarification if needed or suggest alternative options at any time if you believe you have an easier or more knowledgeable approach especially if we are stuck on a step. fter these outlines I give you feel free to reply and once we resolve anything from, this prompt I will describe to you where we are in the process and our current challenges. 

Experiment:
Objective: The primary aim is to analyze fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH) images of cells infected with a virus. You're particularly interested in extracting fluorescence intensities.

Cell Characteristics: The cells are expected to show small circular foci near the poles at early time points. These foci may grow and possibly take over the cells at later time points.

Imaging: The images are not time-lapse but are multiple stages on an individual slide which represent a single sample (grouping of biorep,genotype,condition (infected or uninfected control, and timepoint). The time duration is represented by the names of the images, indicating time points like 0, 10, 20, 40, and 60 minutes.

Infection Types: The dataset includes both infected ("_inf") and uninfected ("_uninf") samples.

Feature Expectations: Our feature cutoff we want to set to be present <10% in the uninfected images, aiming for a significance value of 0.1 or more.

Equipment: A Nikon TI2 inverted microscope is used for imaging, employing epifluorescence

Here is a more detailed outline which will give you context of the wetlab work as well as the image processing steps.


### Experimental Strategy Outline

---

#### Wetlab Procedures

1. **Strain Selection**
    - Utilize multiple strains: LZ22221 (Wildtype), LZ22225 (Parent for normalization), LZ22228, LZ22229, LZ22230.
  
2. **Sample Preparation**
    - Inoculate cultures from a single colony and let them grow for 16 hours.
    - Normalize cultures to an OD of 0.1 while they are in the exponential phase.
    - Carry out infections or maintain uninfected controls.
    - Harvest samples at multiple timepoints: 0 min, 10 min, 20 min, 40 min, and 60 min. Instantly fix the samples to stop any biological processes.

3. **Fluorescent In Situ Hybridization (FISH)**
    - Cells are permeabilized.
    - Hybridize cells with ssDNA FISH probes labeled with a dye.
    - Wash away any unbound probes.

#### Imaging

4. **Capture and Dimensions**
    - Utilize an automated Nikon microscope to capture images.
    - Average number of cells per frame: 5-40.
    - Typical dimensions: XY > 10, C2 or C3 depending on DAPI channel, and Z = 5 steps of 200 nm for Nyquist sampling.
    - Focusing on phase contrast, FISH signal, and DAPI stain.

---

#### Image Processing

5. **Initial Image Processing**(fiji macro)
    - Use a custom Fiji macro to read in the ND2 files as TIFF and perform max intensity projection.
    - Optimize the folder and file structure for batch processing with Omnipose.

6. **Cell Segmentation**(python)
    - Use Omnipose for initial segmentation based on phase images.
    - Consider secondary segmentation or manual adjustments for better accuracy.

7. **Post-Segmentation **(fiji macro)
    - Perform rigorous quality control analysis using three types of images: background-only, cells-only, and the original images, generated from Omnipose masks.
    - Compute average, median, max, and min of the background intensities for comparisons across various conditions.
    - Export Fiji ROI for further analysis.

8. **Post-Segmentation Quality Control (QC) & Analysis**(python)
    - Import segmented images into MicrobeJ, an ImageJ plugin.
    - Measure bacterial and foci morphological characteristics, intensities, and spatial relationships.
** keep in mind strains have 40% of cells (swarmer cells) that are susceptible to infection due to the presence of the viral receptor. The remaining 60% are stalked cells that lack the receptor.



**** also Dilution Variability Some samples may be diluted differently to achieve an interpretable field of view (FOV). Dilution variability could potentially impact the background fluorescence levels and later intensities due to the background subtractions.



9. **Data Analysis and Statistical Testing**
    - Perform quantitative analysis and statistical tests to compare infected and uninfected samples, different timepoints, and strains.
    - Consider metrics like signal-to-noise ratio, fluorescence intensity, and cell area covered by foci.

10. **Comparison and Normalization**
    - Compare metrics across different strains, timepoints, and infection statuses.
    - Initially preserve original signal intensities for variability analysis. Consider normalization at a later stage.

11. **Final Interpretation**
    - Integrate all analyses to interpret the experimental results, paying special attention to variability within and across samples, timepoints, and strains.



here is a rough description and outline of my experiment to help you understand what I am trying to test.  Do you have any questions for clarification about my test, teh reason for my test, the data I desire at the end of my test, or the experimental technique/methods ? 

The sample strategy which i would call the experimental strategy is that we have strains which show varying abilities to be infected for a ssRNA bacteriophage (LZ22225, 22228, 22229, 22230) in which based on other less sensitive assays LZ22229 and LZ22230 cannot be infected at all while LZ22225 is the most infected and therefore serves as the strain we might normalize to and LZ22228 is ~40% as succeptible to infection as LZ22225. 

Each "experiment" I consider as a day in which i do the experiment, but really is composed of a bioreplicate for one or more strains. So experiments can be organized by their bioreplicates in which a bioreplicate is the use of a strain that was grown from a single colony to make all the cultures necessary for the FISH process. The process proceeds by inoculating cultures, allowing them to grow for 16 hours, then either infecting those cultures or not infecting those cultures. The cultures are then taken out at timepoints 0min which si the same sample for infected and uninfected,then the rest of the sampels are trult uninfected or infected for  10min, 20 min, 40min, or 60min and isntantaneously fixed to stop the infection process at the given timepoint before being processed in batches where the cells are then permeabilized, probes are hybridized, and then probes are washed away. 

For each timepoint,strain, bioreplicate, we have controls which were not infected meaning the only signal present should be the background which are the ssDNA FISh probes labeled with a dye that remain with the sample despite no viral gRNA being present. The signal in these images seems to be higher in cells than in background meaning soemthing (many possibilities but possibly partial binding to the chromosome or RNA present in the caulobacter cells naturally) and therefore we want to analyze both internal and external cell fluorescence. The samples are imaged after washing using an agar pad to overlay onthe samples to keep them still (there may be some variability in autolfuroescence of the agar pad this is unknown) and are imaged among multiple stages (regions) of the microscope slide generally n=20 or more stages and try to have between 5-40 cells per stage. All the images taken within a sample are considered to be at the same timepoint since essentially the biological processes were stopped at the fixing step. The images are taken using the nikon software so that the microscope movement is automated and we end with a few files of nd2 images with XY>10 C2or3 depending on if we took the DAPi channel, and Z = 5 steps of 200nm for nyquist sampling. For some reason our lab generally only takes the phase image in the middle channel of the zstack (Z2 or 3 depending on indexing) which can cause downstream data analysis issues that are always frustrating and we need to find a better strategy for.  



Strain Selection: You utilize multiple bacterial strains, including a wildtype and a parent for normalization, as well as others for specific experimental conditions.

Sample Preparation:

You start cultures from a single colony and allow them to grow for 16 hours.
These cultures are then normalized to an optical density (OD) of 0.1 while they're in the exponential growth phase.
You carry out viral infections or maintain uninfected controls as part of the experimental design.
Samples are harvested at multiple timepoints (0, 10, 20, 40, 60 minutes) and are instantly fixed to halt any ongoing biological processes.
Fluorescent In Situ Hybridization (FISH):

Cells in the samples are permeabilized to allow entry of probes.
Single-stranded DNA (ssDNA) FISH probes labeled with a fluorescent dye are used to hybridize the cells.
Any unbound probes are washed away to improve the signal-to-noise ratio in the fluorescence microscopy that follows.
Additional Notes:

About 40% of the cells (swarmer cells) are susceptible to viral infection due to the presence of a viral receptor. The remaining 60% (stalked cells) lack this receptor.
Dilution variability is also considered as some samples may be diluted differently to achieve an interpretable field of view (FOV).

Thank you for the comprehensive outline of your experimental strategy. Your approach is well-structured and addresses several key aspects of viral infection dynamics in bacterial strains with varying susceptibilities to ssRNA bacteriophage infection. The use of FISH technology for real-time monitoring of viral gRNA within the bacterial cells adds a layer of quantitative rigor to the study. Here are some specific points that I find noteworthy:

Experimental Strategy
The choice of strains (LZ22225, 22228, 22229, 22230) with varying susceptibilities to viral infection provides a robust framework for understanding the mechanistic underpinnings of viral entry and replication.
The use of bioreplicates grown from a single colony ensures minimal genetic variability, thereby enhancing the reliability of the results.
Sample Preparation and Timepoints
The 16-hour growth period and subsequent normalization to an OD of 0.1 ensure that the bacterial cultures are in the exponential growth phase, which is crucial for any infection dynamics study.
The timepoints chosen (0, 10, 20, 40, 60 minutes) are well-spaced to capture the kinetics of viral infection and RNA replication.
FISH and Imaging
The use of ssDNA FISH probes labeled with a fluorescent dye is a robust method for tracking viral gRNA within the bacterial cells.
The automated imaging using Nikon software and the subsequent generation of nd2 files with multiple channels and Z-stacks are well-suited for high-throughput analysis.
Controls and Variability
The inclusion of uninfected controls is essential for background correction, especially given that you've observed higher internal cell fluorescence in these samples.
The consideration for dilution variability and the potential autofluorescence of the agar pad are important factors that could affect the quantitative aspects of the study.
Questions for Clarification
Purpose of the Study: Could you elaborate on the specific hypotheses or questions you are aiming to address with this study?
Data Desired: What specific metrics or data points are you most interested in obtaining from this experiment?
Phase Imaging: You mentioned that only the middle channel of the Z-stack is generally used for phase imaging, leading to downstream data analysis issues. Could you elaborate on what these issues are?
Fluorescence Variability: Have you considered any strategies to account for the potential variability in autofluorescence of the agar pad?
Probe Specificity: Given that you've observed higher internal cell fluorescence in uninfected controls, have you considered running additional controls to test the specificity of your FISH probes?
Your experiment is well-designed, and I'm excited to see how the data will inform our understanding of ssRNA bacteriophage infection dynamics in bacterial strains. Would you like to discuss any of these points in more detail?

I will address each of your questions individually before moving on. If you do not understand or if my answers do not make sense please let me know and ask follow up questions.

The purpose of the study is to analyze the effect of different mutations in a protein called CoaF on the ability of single-stranded RNA bacteriophage phiCb5 to infect. Previously in our results, as I mentioned, we have seen that some of the mutants are not able to be infected. These mutants correlate to mutations in CpaF which slow the rate of ATP binding, which is necessary for the retraction of the caulobacter (host) pili. We believe that the retraction event is a necessary step, and the force of the retraction event is a necessary threshold to allow for phicb5 to infect.

We know that the pili are detached from the cell during the infection process. We have as stated seen that lz22229 and lz22230 do not form plaques when infected with PhiCB5 which is a proxy for the ability to infect. We have also seen that these strains show little to no pili detachment compared to uninfected controls of the same strains. So now we are using FISH to see at the genome entry level if we find any signal for the ssRNA genome and if it replicates over time, additionally it is possibly the genome gets stuck on the outside of the cell, or in the pilus basal body, or somewhere else and therefore would still produce signal equivalent to the single genome.
We have carried out this protocol after UV treating the phage to prevent replication and this data should serve as a somewhat good single genome control. 
ChatGPT
Thank you for the detailed explanation of your study's purpose and the specific questions you aim to address. The focus on the role of CoaF mutations and their impact on ATP binding and pili retraction provides a mechanistic depth to the study. It's particularly interesting that you're exploring the force of the pili retraction as a necessary threshold for phicb5 infection.

The use of UV-treated phage as a control for single-genome entry is a smart approach. It will help you distinguish between genome entry and replication, providing a more nuanced understanding of the infection process.

I don't have any further questions at this point; your explanation was quite clear. Would you like to proceed with discussing how to optimize the experimental setup, or is there another aspect you'd like to focus on?

To briefly answer your question number two, the data output that I am looking for is intensity from AlexaFluor 48 labeled DNA fish probes, which should bind to the genome, which I suspect will show single genome, and the UV-infected should show an increase in signal due to replication over time, and the mutants which can be infected, as well as an unknown readout for LZ22229 and LZ22230. As a note, I also have strains LZ2221 and LZ22225. These two strains both have a wild-type copy of CPAF protein. However, LZ22225 and the strains that follow it all express CPAF off of a plasmid, so we wanted to include LZ22221 since it should have a more normal or wild-type readout of signal. However, we would like to normalize to LZ22225 to hopefully eliminate some of the effects of plasmid expression when comparing between mutants. So we would designate lz22221 as wild type and Lz 22225 as parent 
ChatGPT
Thank you for clarifying the data output you're interested in and the rationale behind your strain selection. The focus on AlexaFluor 488-labeled DNA FISH probes to quantify genome entry and replication is well thought out. Your approach to include both LZ22221 and LZ22225 for normalization purposes is also strategic, as it will help control for the effects of plasmid-based CPAF expression.

Given that you're looking for intensity measurements, it's crucial to optimize the microscope settings for capturing the AlexaFluor 488 signal with high sensitivity and low background noise. This will be particularly important for detecting single genomes and for tracking any changes in signal intensity over time.

Would you like to discuss the specific microscope settings and imaging parameters that would be most suitable for capturing this data?

To briefly answer your previous questions, number three seems to no longer be an issue with my data analysis setup. Number four, I have not considered any strategies to account for the potential variability in the autofluorescence of the Augur pad when it comes to the experimental setup. Other than the fact that I generally take the infected and uninfected samples for a given biological replicate on the same Augur pad. Period. I have considered post-processing data steps to look at autofluorescence or background fluorescence for subtractions. We will leave that discussion for another time. Do you think that there will be significant autofluorescent differences based on Augur pads? For number five, probe specificity, I have not considered any additional strategy to look for nonspecific binding of probes. You can mention a few possibilities here. However, based on my knowledge, I don't think that I will pursue them, but it would be good to think about.
ChatGPT
Thank you for addressing the previous questions. It's good to hear that the issue with phase imaging is resolved in your current data analysis setup.

Autofluorescence of Agar Pads: If you're consistently using the same type of agar and the same preparation method, the variability in autofluorescence should be minimal. However, it's a good practice to measure the autofluorescence of the agar pad alone as a control. Since you're already taking infected and uninfected samples on the same agar pad, that should help control for any minor variations.



So Now I am at the steps 8-11 where I am using the calculated masks by omnipose to retrieve data using microbeJ. I also have basic in cell fluorescence and background fluorescence data that is per frame, but I am also interested in looking at this data per cell or even later per foci maybe. So after this I can upload my data and my script to process that datae if youre ready for it ?
