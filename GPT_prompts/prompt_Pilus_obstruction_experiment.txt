# Pilus Obstruction Experimental Overviews
I have a microscopy experiment I am interested in analyzing to see if the data show some type of separation between different treatments of the polar pili producing Bacteria Caulobacter Crescentus. The protocol for the treatments and the imaging of the cells post treatment are below. 

In exploring the dynamic interactions of pili in Caulobacter crescentus, we utilized the pilAT36C cysteine knock-in variant (Ellison 2017), which allows for specific labeling of pili using maleimide conjugation chemistry. The presence of a cysteine residue in the pilus structure provides a reactive thiol group for conjugation with maleimide-functionalized compounds, enabling the attachment of various obstructive and/or fluorescent molecules to the pili under physiological conditions.
The protocol for labeling involved growing C. crescentus to early-exponential phase before normalizing the cell number for optimal microscopy conditions. For pilus obstruction by the PEG-5,000 molecule PEG5000-mal (Invitrogen) was added to achieve a final concentration of 500 µM. Concurrently, fluorophore-conjugated maleimide dye (Invitrogen) was added to a final concentration of 25 µg/ml. The mixture was incubated for 10 minutes at 30°C, followed by washing with media twice before resuspending in an appropriate concentration for imaging.
For conjugation with Streptavidin-AlexaFluor568 (Invitrogen) and Qdot605 Streptavidin conjugates (Invitrogen), a two-step labeling approach was adopted. Cells were initially incubated with 25 µg/ml Maleimide-PEG11-Biotin (Thermo Scientific) with immediate subsequent addition of 25 µg/ml AF488-mal as done previously for pilus obstruction. Following incubation the cells were washed and subsequently incubated with 100 streptavidin conjugates per cell which were incubated 10 min at 30°C before imaging for dynamics and 20 minutes before imaging for pilus release.
 
 
Imaging Pilus Release and Pili Dynamics
For assessing dynamic pili, the samples were prepared immediately following the wash steps. The protocol involved cutting 1% agarose PYE pads into approximately 16mm x 16mm sections, adhering these to small coverslips (18 x 18 mm, Fischer Scientific). 1 µL of the sample was placed on the agar side and allowed to dry for 1 minute. The coverslip was then gently placed, agar side down, onto a larger coverslip (24 x 50 mm, Fisher Scientific). Imaging was done every 12 seconds over 17 frames (204 seconds). This interval was chosen to capture pilus retraction events, and dynamic pili were defined as the number of pilus retraction events per cell. Analysis was carried out using NIS elements software.
Assaying for pilus release followed the same sample preparation as for dynamic pili, except the imaging process involved capturing five Z stacks with 200 nm intervals. Images were taken at multiple stage positions (20 per sample) in phase and 488 channels. The NIS elements software was used to analyze cell and pili counts.


These Experiments were modeled off of a previous paper which used PEG-maleimide to inhibit pilus retraction and analyzed other characteristics of this blockage. My main interst in these methods are to see if this PEG or this biotin streptavidin attached to the pili cause the pili to detach in a similar manner as that of the bacteriophage ΦCB5 infection. I have gone through different sets of images and analyzed the data by eye. After you read this prior work which is attached and review this text let me know your thoughts on the experiment before we move into analyzing any of the data.   


You are encouraged to ask any questions for clarification if needed or suggest alternative options at any time if you believe you have an easier or more knowledgeable approach especially if we are stuck on a step. fter these outlines I give you feel free to reply and once we resolve anything from, this prompt I will describe to you where we are in the process and our current challenges.
