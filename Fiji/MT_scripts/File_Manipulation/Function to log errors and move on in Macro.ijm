To ensure your ImageJ macro continues to run even if an exception occurs, you can implement a form of error handling. ImageJ macro language doesn't have a built-in try-catch mechanism like many other programming languages, but you can use a workaround to achieve a similar result.

The key is to detect when an error occurs and then log the error message without stopping the entire macro. Here's how you can modify your script to include basic error handling:

1. **Implement a Custom Error Logging Function**: 
   - You can create a function to log errors. This function can be called whenever an error is detected.

2. **Use Conditional Checks for Error Detection**:
   - After operations that might fail (like opening an image, processing it, etc.), you can add checks to see if the operation was successful. If not, log the error and continue with the next file.

Here's how you might modify your macro:

```java
// Function to log errors
function logError(message) {
    print("Error: " + message);
}

// ... [rest of your macro code before the file loop] ...

// Loop through all files in the directory
for (i = 0; i < fileList.length; i++) {
    // Attempt to process each file
    try {
        // ... [image processing code] ...

    } catch {
        // If an error occurs, log it and continue with the next file
        logError("Failed to process file: " + fileList[i] + " - " + getLastErrorMessage());
        continue;
    }
}

// Turn off batch mode
setBatchMode(false);
```

In this modification:

- A function `logError` is defined to log any error messages.
- A `try-catch` block is used (in a conceptual sense, since ImageJ macros don't have real try-catch syntax). If an error occurs during the processing of an image, the `catch` block logs the error message and continues with the next iteration of the loop.
- `getLastErrorMessage()` is a hypothetical function to get the last error message. ImageJ macro language does not have a direct equivalent, so you might need to improvise based on the specific errors you encounter. For example, if an operation fails, it might set some variable or state that you can check.

Please note that this script assumes a sort of pseudo-try-catch logic for demonstration purposes. The actual implementation might vary based on the specific errors and behaviors of the ImageJ macro language. The ImageJ macro language has limitations in error handling, so this approach is more about damage control rather than true exception handling as found in languages like Java.

    print("Error: " + message);
}

// ... [rest of your macro code before the file loop] ...

// Loop through all files in the directory
for (i = 0; i < fileList.length; i++) {
    // Attempt to process each file
    try {
        // ... [image processing code] ...

    } catch {
        // If an error occurs, log it and continue with the next file
        logError("Failed to process file: " + fileList[i] + " - " + getLastErrorMessage());
        continue;
    }
}

// Turn off batch mode
setBatchMode(false);
