pilus_release-all_data

I am writing my scientific manuscript and I want you help incorporating some of the actual numbers from a dataset into my writing; however, first I need your help in calculating and making the data presentable. 

here is the results writing I have so far 

ΦCb5 can Bind and Cleave bNY30a T4cP.
To examine the scope of T4P detachment by ssRNA phage infection, we set out to visualize the T4cP of C. crescentus pre and post-infection. To do this, we utilized a previously established hyper-piliated C. crescentus strain harboring T4cP containing of a non-deleterious cysteine knock-in mutant of the major pilin protein, PilAT36C, (YB9040) and infected with ssRNA phage ΦCb5 [14]. To assess the behavior of T4cP after the addition of ΦCb5 particles, pili were labeled with thiol-reactive Alexa Fluor 488 and mixed with purified ΦCb5 at an MOI of 5, or phage buffer. We observed a substantial time-dependent increase in the frequency of non-cell-associated T4cP (free pili) in our infected samples, similar to the case of the F-pilus system when infected with ssRNA phages MS2 and Qbeta [14] (Fig. 1B). In our parent labeling strain, the ratio of free pili per cell undergoes its most significant increase within the first 5 minutes of infection, in stark contrast to the uninfected sample (Fig. 1D). This marked increase in non-cell associated pili provides continued evidence of the pilus release phenomenon among ssRNA phages and their host pili across evolutionarily and functionally distinct pilus systems.

ΦCb5 Infection and Pilus Detachment Require Sufficient Retraction Force.
C. crescentus employs a single bi-functional ATPase CpaF for extension and retraction of its T4cP through polymerization and depolymerization of its major pilin protein PilA[15]. The dual function of CpaF in extension and retraction left us unable to test if retraction is required for ΦCb5 infection, as in previous ssRNA phage studies [14]. Instead, we took advantage of previously published C. crescentus strains with mutations in the ATP binding site of CpaF. These mutations diminish ATPase activity, resulting in reduced extension/retraction speeds and force [16]. We assessed the ΦCb5 plaquing efficiency via a standard titer assay utilizing hosts with ΔcpaF deletion complemented by CpaF/CpaFmutant expressed from a plasmid to characterize their efficiency of plating (EOP) (Fig. 1C). Remarkably, ΦCb5 failed to form any plaques on strains containing CpaFF244L/K245R and CpaFD310N mutants with low retraction forces, even at a high concentration of 1011 pfu/mL. Additionally, ΦCb5 exhibited reduced efficiency of plating (EOP) on the CpaFI355C host with an intermediate retraction force. This absence of plaque formation and reduced EOP, even with a high phage concentration, underscores the essential role of host-generated retraction force in facilitating ΦCb5 infection. The lack of any adaptive phage response, despite the high mutation potential within the ssRNA genome replication, suggests that the phage cannot compensate for the diminished retraction force in the host. This finding suggests supports the hypothesis that host retraction force is a critical factor in the infection process of ssRNA phages. 

Subsequently, we employed fluorescence microscopy to investigate the relationshipz between pilus release at the single-cell level and plaque formation. We fluorescently labeled CpaF mutant cells and infected with ΦCb5 as described above. In the ΦCb5 treated sample, strains expressing CpaF and CpaFI355C significantly increased free pili within the first 5 minutes of infection (Fig. 1C). Conversely, strains expressing CpaFD310N and CpaFF244L/K245R showed only background levels of free pili (Fig 1D, Supp Fig. 2E-H). These data establish a clear correlation between ΦCb5 plaque formation, a proxy for successful infection, and pilus detachment. Crucially, our findings reveal that ΦCb5 infection is contingent on the host cell's ability to generate sufficient retraction force for pilus detachment. This force is likely a prerequisite for phage genomic RNA (gvRNA) entry into the host. Mat-pilus binding interaction and the internal pilin-pilin interactions. Consequently, the generated retraction force becomes pivotal, effectively providing the necessary catalyst for pilus breakage, in which the pilin-pilin interactions are overcome, allowing the gvRNA to enter the cell.  



here is the method I am using 

T4cP Detachment Assay


To asses pilus detachment, labeled C. crescentus cells underwent a final resuspension in 50 µL PYE media, again using a cut tip for resuspension by pipetting, before splitting into prewarmed tubes where they were infected at an MOI = 5 with sucrose gradient purified ΦCb5 or an equivalent volume of phage buffer. Infections were performed without shaking to minimize pilus agitation. Samples were removed at indicated time points and dispensed into pre-chilled tubes and allowed to equilibrate on ice. Samples were prepared for microscopy by cutting 1.5% agarose pad dissolved in PYE media approximately 16mm x 16mm and adhering it to a small coverslip (18 x 18 mm, Fischer Scientific). 1 µL of sample was placed in the center of the agarose side of the adhered coverslip and allowed to dry for 1 minute. Finally, the small coverslip is flipped and gently adhered agarose side down onto a large coverslip (24 x 50 mm, Fisher Scientific) allowing the wave front of the agar pad to move evenly across the coverslip. A series of 5-11 Z stacks of 200 nm were used to precisely image pili. Samples were imaged on multiple stage positions (20 per sample) in phase-contrast (100 ms to detect cells) and green channels (100 ms to detect pili). The images were analyzed using NIS elements software for cell and pili counts.


can you read in the data and lets start to make sense of it by reading the column names
