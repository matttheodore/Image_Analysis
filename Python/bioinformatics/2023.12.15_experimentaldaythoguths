ok. on further investigation LZ22221 all flasks are showing low readings at 0.04. We will follow these and see if they continue to grow or not. It is still unknown to me why they didnt grow well so I will investigate the original, overnight culture qualitatively looking at DIC and phase imaging and look back at my notes to check if I have evr done 1:1000 growth. Maybe they will veentually come out of lag and begin to grow exponentially .. but the growth rates are so slow that it is unlikely I will be able to use them for experimentation today as it would set me back about 4 hours assuming they are growing exponentially now and nothing is wrong with the cells. 


also it seems that my experimental growths may be different across the board as for LZ2225 

The calculated doubling times for the LZ22225 growth between 10:45 AM and 11:45 AM across the five flasks are approximately as follows (in hours):

Flask 1: 1.34 hours
Flask 2: 1.24 hours
Flask 3: 1.43 hours
Flask 4: 1.44 hours
Flask 5: 1.42 hours
To compare these doubling times with previous growths, LZ22225, which were around 2.47 hours and 2.38 hours the current doubling times are shorter, indicating a faster growth rate during this time interval.


I will proceed to check cell morphologies etc under the microscope for qualitative analysis.
